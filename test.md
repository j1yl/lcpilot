Given an array of integers `nums`and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.\\n
\\n
You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution** , and you may not use the same element twice.\\n
\\n
You can return the answer in any order.\\n

**Example 1:**\\n
Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`\\n
Output: `[0,1]`\\n
Explanation: `Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].`\\n
\\n
**Example 2:**\\n
Input: `nums = [3,2,4], target = 6`\\n
Output: `[1,2]`\\n
\\n
**Example 3:**\\n
Input: `nums = [3,3], target = 6`\\n
Output: `[0,1]`\\n
\\n
**Constraints:**\n
- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`  
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`  
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`  
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

Can you come up with an algorithm that is less than `O(n^2)`time complexity?
